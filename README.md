# wineQualityDetection
This project classifies wine quality into low, medium, and high using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Stacking. Models are trained, evaluated (accuracy, confusion matrix, F1-score), and compared. The best model is saved, with detailed metrics and visualizations for performance transparency.
