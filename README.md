Wine Quality Classification using Machine Learning Models
Overview
This project classifies wine quality into three categories: low, medium, and high. It leverages multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Stacking, to evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Dataset
The dataset contains physicochemical properties of wine (e.g., acidity, sugar content, and pH) and a target variable (quality) ranging from 1 to 9. These quality scores are categorized into:

Low (1–3): Poor quality wine.
Medium (4–6): Average quality wine.
High (7–9): High-quality wine.
Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing:

Loaded and cleaned the dataset by removing duplicates and handling outliers.
Balanced class distribution using SMOTE to address imbalances.
Applied log transformations to skewed features and scaled features for normalization.
2. Model Building:

Trained the following models:
Logistic Regression: For baseline comparison.
Random Forest: For feature importance and robust classification.
XGBoost and LightGBM: Gradient boosting models for improved accuracy.
Stacking: Combined predictions of Random Forest and LightGBM for optimal performance.
3. Model Evaluation:

Evaluated each model using:
Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions.
Precision, Recall, F1-Score: For detailed classification performance.
Confusion Matrix: Visual representation of true vs. predicted classes.
Identified the best-performing model based on accuracy.
4. Visualization:

Generated the following plots:
Confusion matrices for each model.
A bar chart comparing model accuracies.
Key Features
Class Balancing: Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE.
